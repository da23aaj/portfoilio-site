        <h2>Daniel Aroela</h2>
        <p>
            I’m a second-year Computer Science student at the University of Hertfordshire, with a strong passion for Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity. 
            I’m fascinated by how AI can solve real-world problems, from creating smarter systems to helping improve our daily lives.
            At the same time, I’m really interested in Cybersecurity because of its importance in protecting our data and keeping us safe in the digital world. 
            I enjoy learning about how these fields work and finding practical ways to apply what I’ve learned.
             My goal is to use my knowledge to build secure and intelligent technologies that make a positive difference in the world.</p>
