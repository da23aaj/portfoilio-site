            <h2>Web Development</h2>
            <img src="web.jpg" alt="Web Development" class="interest-image">
            <p>I love web development because it allows me to bring ideas to life and create something that people can interact with and enjoy. 
                There’s something incredibly rewarding about starting with just a blank screen and turning it into a functional, visually appealing website that serves a purpose. 
                I enjoy the mix of creativity and logic it offers – from designing layouts and picking colors to solving coding challenges and making everything work seamlessly. 
                Plus, the fast-paced nature of web development keeps me excited to learn new tools and technologies, and it’s amazing to see how the things I build can make a real impact in connecting people and sharing information.</p>

            <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
            <img src="images.jpg" alt="Machine Learning" class="interest-image">
            <p>I love machine learning because it feels like unlocking the future with every concept I learn and project I work on. 
                The idea that we can teach machines to recognize patterns, make predictions, and even solve problems on their own is both fascinating and exciting to me. 
                What I enjoy most is how machine learning can be applied to so many areas, like improving healthcare, creating smarter technologies, and even personalizing everyday experiences. 
                It’s like combining math, programming, and creativity to make something that truly makes a difference. 
                Seeing a model I’ve built actually work – whether it’s identifying images or predicting outcomes – is such a rewarding feeling, and it drives me to keep exploring the endless possibilities this field offers.</p>
